# Language-Modelling

This is the Language Modelling based on the Natural Language Processing Model
In this we are using the N-Gram Language Model
where we are puting the two previous words based on that next word is predicted

## Note
I've used the dataset from my own drive in google colab if you are downloading the dataset from this repo
then you have to change the paths in during reading the file.
keep this in mind during bulidng your own model
